## Hypervisor Overview
<pre>
- is hardware virtualization technology
- this helps us run multiple Operating System on a laptop/desktop/workstation/server
- i.e more than one OS can be actively running on the same machine
- this type of virtualization is considered heavy-weight as each Virtual Machine(VM - Guest OS) requires dedicated hardware resources
  - CPU Cores
  - RAM
  - Storage ( HDD/SDD )
- each VM represents a fully functional Operating System
- the OS that runs within Virtual Machine is referred as Guest OS
- each Guest OS has its own dedicated OS Kernel
- there are two of Hypervisors  
  1. Type 1
  - Bare-Metal Hypervisors
  - Used in Servers & Workstations
  - Virtual Machines(Guest OS) can be created directly on top of hardware with no Host OS requirement
  - Examples
    - VMWare vSphere/vCenter
  2. Type 2
  - used in Laptops/Desktops/Workstations
  - Examples
    - Oracle VirtualBox ( supported in Windows/Linux/Mac OS-X )
    - Parallels ( supported in Mac OS-X )
    - KVM ( supported in all Linux Distributions )
    - VMWare Fusion ( supported in Mac OS-X - Free, earlier it was a paid software, not actively maintained anymore )
    - VMWare Workstation Pro ( was a paid software but now it is Free, works in Linux & Windows )
    - Microsoft Hyper-V
